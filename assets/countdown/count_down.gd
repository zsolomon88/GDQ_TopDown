## A counter that displays words one at a time.
##
## The Countdown node is a label that displays, in order, any amount of 
## strings set in the [member counting_steps] property, and plays an animation for each. [br]
## Each string is shown for [member step_duration] seconds; once all the strings
## have appeared, the [signal counting_finished] signal is emitted.[br]
## Once the countdown finishes, the node hides on its own until [member start_counting]
## is called again.[br]
## [br]
## [b]Note[/b]: Any text written in the editor will be removed when [member start_counting]
## runs.
